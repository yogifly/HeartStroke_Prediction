# ü©∫ Heart Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository implements the research paper:  
**"Stacking Model for Heart Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques"**  
by Subasish Mohapatra et al., *EAI Endorsed Transactions on Pervasive Health and Technology*, 2023.  

The project uses **machine learning models** and a **stacking ensemble** to predict the risk of stroke in patients based on medical attributes.  
It also provides an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** with **SHAP & LIME explanations** for interpretability.

## üìñ Overview
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and stroke are leading causes of death worldwide.  
Early prediction of stroke risk can help in **timely intervention and treatment**.

This project:
- Trains multiple **ML algorithms** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)
- Uses a **Stacking Ensemble model** to improve accuracy
- Achieves up to **97.67% accuracy** (Gradient Boosting)
- Deploys a **Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions
- Adds **Explainability** with **SHAP & LIME** to show which factors contributed most to predictions

## üìä Dataset
We used the **[Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)** from Kaggle.

- **Rows**: ~5,000 patient records  
- **Features**:
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Hypertension
  - Heart Disease
  - Ever Married
  - Work Type
  - Residence Type
  - Average Glucose Level
  - BMI
  - Smoking Status
- **Target**: `stroke` (0 = No stroke, 1 = Stroke)
